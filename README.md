# SQL_LLM_PROJECT
This project leverages GPT-4 to translate natural language inputs into SQL queries. It features the ability to validate and execute queries against an SQLite database. Users can enter a natural language query, and the tool generates the corresponding SQL, ensuring syntactic correctness and allowing for execution against specified schemas

Natural Language to SQL: Converts user input in plain English to SQL queries.
Query Validation: Ensures generated queries are correct and execute properly.
Database Execution: Runs SQL queries directly against an SQLite database.
Custom Schema Support: Generates SQL based on user-specified database schemas.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for ease of use and navigation.
